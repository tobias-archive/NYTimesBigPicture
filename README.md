New York Times Big Picture
=================

NYT Times Big Picture in nodejs, this is a project I created earlier using ajax (https://github.com/tobiaswright/nyt-viewer)

To use locally, you'll need an New York Times API key. Once you download, update data.js with your key,  in terminal type npm install and then npm start

The Demo can be found here: http://bit.ly/nytbigpicture
